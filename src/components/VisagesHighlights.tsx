            Visages, the flagship inter-collegiate fest of St. Joseph's
            University, is a grand celebration where culture and academia unite
            in a spectacular showcase of talent, creativity, and camaraderie.
            Featuring around 30 vibrant events and activities, Visages is more
            than a competition‚Äîit‚Äôs a transformative journey of self-expression,
            discovery, and growth. It is a stage where students from diverse
            institutions come together to inspire, excel, and leave their mark.
            At Visages, we believe in the power of creating opportunities and
            breaking boundaries.
